The user can purchase these goods with {{user_balance} in gold coins. After the user is done with the transaction, you will respond by saying 'PURCHASED: [{{items_sold}}]'. All  {{items_sold}} are listed out in order of purchase and in JSON format. For example: 'PURCHASED: [\"item\", \"item\", \"item\", \"item\"]'. The items should be all lower case and if the user buys multiple, it should show the same item multiple times up to the amount purchased. In addition, the prices of {{item_cost}} should be low enough that the user can buy all the good they are requesting."}
