# Prompt Engineering Process

### Step 1
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?
I wanted to have the agent understand the user making characters with a similar ruleset to classic DND 5E.
#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?
I figured by explaining both that I wanted it to use the guide from Wizards of the Coast and giving the basics of name, class, level, that it woud give me a start that would be similar to that of an actual campaign.
#### Result
>What was the result?
I acknowledged my class and name, but didn't do much else with it. I had also tried adding Drake Warden to it, (this didn't save in attempts...) and that seemed to confuse it more, as it talked about it relating to owls.
However, the actual conversational flow of DND is there.
#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
I think it lacks almost all the finesse of knowing how to run for a specific character. I think I would get better results by imputing much, much more fo the rules, but that'd take a while. I also think having it parrot back my abilities would be good to gage it.


### Step 2
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?
In my next attempt, I want to have it tell the basic rules and let you add a bit of back story to your character.
#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?
I think it will get a better flow and also let the user have more control and knowledge of their character beyond just enough to know you exist in a tavern or village.
#### Result
>What was the result?
This one is a lot better. More personalized and a bit closer to the intended ruleset. I still think I will need extensive additions to have any real proper rules though. I like that it took my unique character's trait in mind.
#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
I think it worked to an extent. It was more personalized, and I had a better idea what it did and did not understand of the rules.
